cliprector
==========

a simple CSS clip rect() generator tool

I had this idea a while back and even started it but scrapped it not too long after.  Then I saw this tool: http://bennettfeely.com/clippy/ and it inspired me to do it again.

It uses the HTML5 Drag-and-Drop and File APIs so please make sure you're on a browser that supports.  Yes, yes, I know, I'm using new APIs to generate old CSS.
